0.0.1.
-First implementation

0.0.2
-Added unit tests.
-Added a skeleton TLight class for calculation of light on each point p.
-Added Gaussian integration in unit Model_Integration.

0.0.3
-Gaussian integration over spherical transformation of ellipsoid.

0.0.4
-Intersection with gap walls calculated with gap as cylinder.

0.1.5
-All formulas implemented.

0.1.6
-All integration intervals are now variables and set in the create methods so
 they can be changed at runtime.

0.1.7
-Integrations with f_omega now split over leaf angle classes.

0.2.0
-Major light absorption calculation change: now uses Kf.
-Error in TVegetation.pathlength corrected: beam through gap upward for
 a point p below the vegetation with no vegetation intersection erronously
 still yielded a path length instead of 0.

0.2.1
-Error handling when reading excel files (ReadExcelPlot.ReadData) improved.
-Error in photosynthesis calculations found (in analytical model and
 program), will be corrected in next version.

0.3.0
-Photosynthesis calculations corrected.
-Class TEnvironment introduced, holding Assimilation and Absorption and the
 Crown, Vegetation, Light and Photosynthesis details.
-Introduced an extra identifier 'id' for the Kf_table to distinguish between calls
 out of I() and out of P(). Otherwise lookup is incorrect.
-Integration settings (interval/number of points) for I_L and P.

0.3.1
-Spelling error corrected in error message.
-Changed tab sheet titles.

0.4.x
-Moved to Delphi 2007?

0.5.x
-Initial work on an extension for cut lanes.
-Improved behaviour of progress bar and timer.
-Changed String type in UExcel to AnsiString.

0.6.0
-Ported to Lazarus/Freepascal.
-Removed incomplete lane-based stuff.
-Removed Windows/Delphi-specific multithreading code.
-Removed About and Exit buttons.
-Initial directories for Open and Save set to working directory.
