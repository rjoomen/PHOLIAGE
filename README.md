# PHOLIAGE
Photosynthesis and Light Absorption Model

## Details

PHOLIAGE is a 3D model that calculates light absorption and photosynthesis for trees in opened canopies (e.g. for enrichment planting). For a full description, see the [model description](doc/PHOLIAGE_Model-Report_20070305.pdf) and the [program manual](doc/PHOLIAGE_Model-Program_Manual.pdf).

A related model for closed canopies is [StratiPHOLIAGE](https://github.com/rjoomen/StratiPHOLIAGE).

## Implementation details

### Lazarus / Delphi

The original version was written in Delphi. This is the version ported to Lazarus / FPC.

Main functional changes
- Supports multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, and macOS).
- Reads *.xls, *.xlsx, and *.ods files natively (previous version used Windows-only Excel OLE automation).
- Removed Windows/Delphi-specific multithreading code (too much work to port).
- Removed some initial code for a planned extension for lane-based simulations.

For further details, see the [changelog](doc/changelog.txt).

### Numerical differences between versions

Between versions 0.3 and 0.5 exist small differences in the results, for which the changelog does not give an explanation. Correlation (RÂ²) between results from both versions is still almost 1, as tested with the example data.

Between versions 0.5 and 1.0.0 exist negligible differences (~1e-13), and the differences between the Win64 and Linux/Win32 versions are even smaller.

Model results can differ slightly between Linux/Win32 builds and Win64 builds, because on Win64 the 80-bit floating point `Extended` datatype is not supported. The Math unit therefore internally uses Double (64 bit) instead of Extended, leading to minute differences. This is not a problem, the loss in precision is negligible, and the PHOLIAGE model itself uses Double for all calculations anyway. For details see for example [this forum post](http://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=29678.0), and the source code of the Math unit.
